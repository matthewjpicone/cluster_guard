# PostgreSQL Replication Monitor

## Project Description
PostgreSQL Replication Monitor is a tool designed for database administrators and developers working with PostgreSQL. It offers a graphical user interface to monitor the replication status and delay between a PostgreSQL master and slave server. Using \`psycopg2\` for database connections and \`tkinter\` for the GUI, this application provides real-time insights into the health and performance of your PostgreSQL server replication setup.

## Features

- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Continuously checks and displays the replication status of PostgreSQL master and slave servers.
- **Replication Delay Visualization**: Plots replication delay over time to identify trends and potential issues.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy-to-use GUI built with tkinter for straightforward interaction and visualization.

## Installation

To set up PostgreSQL Replication Monitor, you will need Python installed on your system, along with the following Python packages: \`psycopg2\`, \`tkinter\`, and \`matplotlib\`.

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install psycopg2 matplotlib
   ```
   Note: `tkinter` usually comes pre-installed with Python. If not, install it using your system's package manager.

## Usage

Run the application by executing:

```bash
$ python postgresql_replication_monitor.py
```

Upon launching, the GUI will display the current replication status of the master and slave servers and show a plot of the replication delay over time.

## Contributing

Contributions to improve PostgreSQL Replication Monitor are welcomed. To contribute:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/YourFeature`).
3. Make your changes and commit (`git commit -m 'Add some feature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/YourFeature`).
